# Image2Story


An app for making a little story base on an image.

You will need to install:


* pip install azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
* pip install azure-cognitiveservices-speech
* pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-speech
* pip install openai
* pip install pygame
* pip install requests
* pip install urlparse3
* pip install Pillow

I made it with python 3.x

You need to set the keys from the different services for it to work.

You will also need to have an Azure account and setup the voice and computer vision resources.
Then you will need an OpenAI account so you can get the API key for that. 

It's terrible, I know but it literally one of my first projects.
